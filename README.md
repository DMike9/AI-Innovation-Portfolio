# AI Innovation Portfolio

## Overview

This repository contains a series of advanced AI projects focused on practical applications and architectural innovation. The goal is to demonstrate how artificial intelligence can be applied to solve complex problems in efficient, scalable, and real-world ways.

The work here reflects ongoing experimentation with model optimization, applied machine learning, and human-in-the-loop system design. Each project is independently structured, with code, model logic, and documentation organized for clarity and review.

This portfolio is intended for technical reviewers, hiring teams, or collaborators who want to understand how I approach AI developmentâ€”from system design through to execution.

## Repository Structure

Each project folder includes:

- A focused AI solution or architectural prototype
- Clear summary and rationale in the project-level README
- Jupyter notebooks for development and results
- Source files for core model logic or system code
- Visual outputs or saved model artifacts, where applicable

## Included Projects

### 1. Transformer Efficiency (HTIS)
Implements a Hierarchical Token Importance Scoring (HTIS) mechanism to reduce transformer model compute costs while preserving accuracy. Uses an ensemble of feature extractors to evaluate token relevance across layers.

### 2. AI Hospital Command Center
Prototype of a real-time command center for hospitals. Includes discharge prediction models, override workflows, and a lightweight dashboard for care team coordination and resource planning.

### 3. Zero-Shot Governance Classification with LLMs
Explores the use of large language models to classify governance or compliance documents without fine-tuning. Includes structured prompt chaining and error-handling via Reflexion.

## Additional Focus Areas

Beyond the specific projects listed, this work also reflects broader areas of interest:

- Model compression and inference efficiency
- Applied AI for public sector and health systems
- Zero-trust-aligned machine learning architectures
- Multi-agent coordination, simulation, and decision flow
- Human-centered interfaces for operational AI systems

## Getting Started

Each project includes setup instructions in its `README.md` file. Notebooks are intended to be self-contained and can be run locally or in any standard Jupyter environment.
